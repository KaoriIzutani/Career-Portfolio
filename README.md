### Live Project
For our final project, I worked with a group of 10-15 students on an actual theatre website for two weeks. The client currently uses a website created in Wordpress.

Theatre administrators can login and update current and past shows, add cast members and manage theatre rentals. Subscribers can login and purchase tickets for a show or current season. Our tasks were divided into stories. My strengths cater to the front end, with using HTML and CSS to style the look and feel of the webpages. Here are the highlights of my Live Project work:
